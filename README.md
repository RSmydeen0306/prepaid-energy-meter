# ‚ö° Prepaid Energy Meter Using Arduino & GSM
A smart prepaid electricity billing system developed using Arduino and GSM technology. This project allows users to recharge credits via SMS, monitor real-time electricity usage, and automatically disconnects power once credits are exhausted.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Eliminate manual electricity billing errors.
- Enable SMS-based credit recharges remotely.
- Display real-time usage.
- Balance on an LCD.
- Automatically cut off power when credits run out.

## üß∞ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- GSM Module (SIM800L or similar)
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Relay Module
- Current Sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Resistors
- Connectors
- Power Supply
## üõ†Ô∏è Software & Tools Used

## üîß How to Use
1. Upload the `prepaid_meter.ino` file to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Assemble the hardware components as shown in the `circuit.jpg` image.
3. Insert a valid SIM card with SMS balance into the GSM module.
4. Power on the system:
   - The LCD will show the current credit balance.
   - If balance is sufficient, the load is switched ON.
   - The system alerts and turns OFF the load when credit runs out.
5. Send SMS in the predefined format to recharge credits.

## üñºÔ∏è Prepaid Energy Meter ‚Äì Circuit Operation Flow (Step-by-Step)
Start
‚û°Ô∏è Initialize Arduino UNO
‚û°Ô∏è LCD Initialization
Displays "System Starting..."
‚û°Ô∏è GSM Module Initialization
Wait for GSM network response
‚û°Ô∏è Check Balance Stored in EEPROM
If balance is > 0, continue
Else, display "Recharge Required"
‚û°Ô∏è Relay is Turned ON
Power flows to load (e.g., fan, bulb)
‚û°Ô∏è Energy Meter Sends Pulses to Arduino
Based on power consumption
‚û°Ô∏è Arduino Calculates Units Consumed
1 pulse = 1 unit (based on meter type)
‚û°Ô∏è Deduct Cost per Unit from Balance
Display updated balance on LCD
‚û°Ô∏è If Balance < Minimum Limit
Send SMS alert via GSM: "Low Balance!"
‚û°Ô∏è If Balance = 0
Turn OFF Relay
Display "Power Disconnected"
Send SMS: "Balance Exhausted"
‚û°Ô∏è Wait for Recharge via SMS
Example SMS: #RECHARGE#100
‚û°Ô∏è Arduino Reads SMS
Parse the message, update EEPROM
‚û°Ô∏è Balance Updated
Relay turns ON
Display "Recharge Successful"
End / Loop
